# SeniorProject

### Important info
If you want to test the VR-supported version of the game, you must have SteamVR
installed and a compatible VR headset. We designed the game using the Meta
Quest 2, but other headsets that support SteamVR and have a grip and trigger
button on the controllers might work.

Additional Angel players require a standard video game controller (such as Xbox
or PlayStation controllers) to be connected to the PC.

### How to pull
- Create a Unity 3D URP Project
- Once open, close Unity and go to the directory for the project
- Delete the Assets, Packages, and ProjectSettings folders
- Open git in the project folder and type these commands:
> git init
>
> git remote add SeniorProject - https://github.com/WillJoeLee/SeniorProject.git
>
> git pull SeniorProject

If running the game without VR:
> git checkout Game_without_VR

If running the game with VR:
> git checkout Game_with_VR

You should now be able to launch the game via the Unity project.

MidJourney was used to generate textures and reference images used for 3D models
in the game, and the gitignore template was provided by GitHub. Additional
